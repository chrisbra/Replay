Functionality

This plugin allows you to record and replay your changes that have been done
to a buffer.


                                                            *:StartRecord*
:StartRecord[!] [Tag]       This will start a new record session, that will be
                            called Tag. If [Tag] is not given, use the
                            "Default" tag name. If the tag already exists, an
                            error is given and it will be aborted. Use ! to
                            overwrite an existing tag name.
                            You can use <Tab> to complete the available Tag
                            names

                                                            *:StopRecord*
:StopRecord[!] [Tag]        Recording Session for the Tag will stop at this
                            change.
                            If you don't enter a Tag name, the last started
                            recording session will stop.
                            You can use <Tab> to complete the available Tag
                            names

                                                                    *:Replay*
:Replay [Tag]               Start Replaying your Session, that is identified
                            by the tag Tag. If Tag is not given, use the
                            default tag "Default"
                            You can use <Tab> to complete the available Tag
                            names

                                                            *:ScreenCapture*
:ScreenCapture[!] [-shell] [filename]

                            If you have enabled screen capturing to video,
                            this command will start a screen capturing session
                            to video or stop it (if :ScreenCapture!) is used.
                            If you used the -shell argument, a new shell will
                            be started, else the current Vim session will be
                            recorded.
                            [filename] can optionally be given and
                            will be the name of the recorded session with the
                            date appended to it. See also |Replay-record| for
                            how to enable it.

                                                            *:ListRecords*
:ListRecords                Show which tags are available. This presents a
                            little table that looks like this:

    Tag Starttime               Start           Stoptime        Stop~
=====================================================================
   abcd 27.08.2010 14:12:01     164     27.08.2010 14:12:11     168
Default 27.08.2010 14:09:26     0       -------------------

That means one Recording called "abcd" was started in the undo-tree with the
change number 164. (You can jump back to that change using :undo 164, see also
|:undo|.) Recording time for that tag started on August, 27, 2010 at 14:12:01
o'clock and recording will stop at change number 168 which was at 14:12:11
o'clock. Please bear in mind, that the starting time for the Default-Tag can't
exactly be given, but is the first time, any of the above commands was called.

==============================================================================
3 Replay Configuration                                       *Replay-config*

3.1 Replay Speed                                              *Replay-speed*

You can configure the speed, with which to replay the changes, that have been
done. By default, Replay.vim pauses for 200ms after every change. If you want
to change this, set the variable g:replay_speed to a value in milliseconds in
your |.vimrc| >

    let g:replay_speed = 300
<
will replay your editing session with slower and pauses for 300ms after every
change.

3.2 Replay Recording                                        *Replay-record*

It is possible to record the replay using avconv/ffmeg. For this to work, you
need ffmpeg/avconv installed and vim needs to be run on an X11-Server. To
enable this, set the variable g:replay_record to 1 in your |.vimrc| like this: >


    let g:replay_record = 1
<
When the replay is started, it will be recorded using ffmpeg/avconv for
screencapturing and the result will be saved as Vim_Recording_YYYYMMDD.mkv (in
case you haven't specified an optional filename else it will be saved as
filename_YYYYMMDD.mkv) in either the current working directory (|:pwd|) if it
is writable or your $HOME directory. If you have used the optional -shell
argument, a new |:sh| will be started.

(Note, this currently works only on Unix/Linux and you need ffmpeg or avconv
in your $PATH for this to work)

==============================================================================
4. Replay Feedback                                         *Replay-feedback*
